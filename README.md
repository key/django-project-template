# Django 4.2+ Project Template

This is a simple Django 4.2+ project template with a modern setup. Most Django project templates make too many assumptions or are overly complicated. This template makes minimal assumptions while providing a useful foundation for new projects.

## Features

- Django 4.2+ with Python 3.12 support
- Uses [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for dependency management
- REST API support with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- Development tools:
  - [django-debug-toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.org) for debugging and performance insights
  - [django-extensions](http://django-extensions.readthedocs.org) for useful development commands
  - [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for code quality
- Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL and Redis
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- HTTPS and security settings for staging and production
- PostgreSQL database support with psycopg2-binary
- Redis cache integration with django-redis
- Sentry integration for error tracking
- Bjoern WSGI server for high-performance request handling
- WhiteNoise for static file serving

## How to install

### Prerequisites

Install system requirements:

```bash
brew bundle  # On macOS
# For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install -y libev-dev direnv
```

### Create a new project

Create a Django project from this template:

```bash
django-admin startproject \
  --template=https://github.com/key/django-project-template/archive/master.zip \
  --name=env.example \
  --extension=py,md,yml \
  project_name
```

### Setup environment

Create `.env` from `env.example` and allow direnv:

```bash
mv env.example .env
direnv allow .
```

### Install dependencies

Install Python modules:

```bash
# For macOS with Homebrew
C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib pipenv install --dev

# For Ubuntu/Debian
pipenv install --dev
```

### Start development services

Start PostgreSQL and Redis using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Environment variables

This template uses [django-configurations](https://django-configurations.readthedocs.io/) for class-based settings. The `DJANGO_CONFIGURATION` environment variable determines which settings class to use.

### Common environment variables

These variables are used in all environments:

```
DJANGO_CONFIGURATION=Dev  # Options: Dev, Test, Prod
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:15432/project_name'
CACHE_URL='redis://localhost:16379/1'
```

### Production environment variables

These settings are used in staging and production environments:

```
DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=31536000
DJANGO_SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT=''
DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_HOST=''
DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT='yes'
DJANGO_SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER='HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO,https'
SENTRY_DSN='your-sentry-dsn'  # For error tracking
```

## Development

### Running the server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Running tests

Run tests with:

```bash
python manage.py test --configuration=Test
```

## Deployment

This template can be deployed to various platforms:

1. **Self-hosted server**: Use the built-in Bjoern WSGI server for high performance
2. **Docker**: The template is Docker-ready with the included compose.yaml
3. **Cloud platforms**: Compatible with most cloud platforms that support Django
